## Introduction

SQLAlchemy is a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. This repository contains code examples, exercises, and notes from two excellent SQLAlchemy tutorials. The goal is to help you understand and effectively use SQLAlchemy for database interactions in Python applications.

## Tutorials

The code and notes in this repository are based on the following YouTube tutorials:

1. [SQLAlchemy 2.0 Core Crash Course - Use Python for Seamless Interaction with Relational Databases](https://youtu.be/CfZGWH_vNO0?si=F8XI8IqtbAvLbTGM)  
2. [SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM Crash Course - Manage Relational Databases with Python (SQLAlchemy 2.0)](https://youtu.be/XWtj4zLl_tg?si=HIKd-FeEyO744gML)  

Noted: **Core Crahh Course** mainly focuses on SQL statement whereas **ORM Crash Course** focuses on ORM. Although some parts of the videos are the same, it serves for different purposes. And thus the code inside is divided into v1 (SQL) and v2 (ORM).
